## Questions for Dr. Ziqi Li:

1. Best practices for transforming data: how do I determine if it's necessary, etc.
2. How do I handle integer data? It is numeric, but acts as categorial
3. How to fix issues in residual vs. fitted/Q-Q plot?
4. How and when should I use data normalization?
5. Is there a way to not use all available threads with gwr?
